Digital Clock with Rotating Hands
This project implements a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a stylish clock face with rotating hour, minute, and second hands. The clock is designed with an elegant appearance, incorporating a background image and smooth animations for the clock hands.

Features:
Rotating Clock Hands: The clock hands (hour, minute, and second) rotate smoothly based on the current time.
Customizable Styling: The clock's appearance can be customized by modifying the CSS, including the background image and hand styles.
Real-Time Updates: The clock continuously updates the hand positions every second using JavaScript, providing a real-time clock display.
Visual Effects: The hands move with a smooth transition and "pop" when they reach the top of the clock.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the clock.
CSS: Used for styling the clock face, hands, and background, as well as implementing smooth transitions and animations.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for updating the time and rotating the clock hands accordingly.
